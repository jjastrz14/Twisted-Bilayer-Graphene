(PNAS July 26, 2011 108 (30) 12233-12237; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1108174108)

This is my Bachelor thesis at Wroclaw University of Science including:

* Continnum model of TBG with 4 neighbours at spin-orbit couplin added as in J.-X. Lin et al., Science 10.1126/science.abh2889 (2022)
* Tight-binding model of graphene with sp^3d^5 orbitals
